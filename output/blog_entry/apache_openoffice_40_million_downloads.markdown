<p>We've reached another big milestone <span class="st">â€” 40 million downloads of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> 3.4.x since the release of 3.4.0 in May 2012.&nbsp; You can view a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/stats/downloads.html">detailed chart </a>on our Stats page. </span></p><span class="st"> 
    <p>40 million.&nbsp; A number like this is hard to imagine.&nbsp; With news every day of government budgets and deficits in the trillions, what does 40 million mean?</p> 
    <p>One way is to look at the value, as free open source software, this brings to the public.&nbsp; We looked at it from this angle in a previous blog post, <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/21_million_per_day">$21 million per Day</a>.</p> 
    <p>Another way is to think in physical terms.&nbsp; What if the 40 million copies of Apache OpenOffice were distributed on CD ROM rather than distributed electronically (with the generous support of Geeknet and their SourceForge distribution network)?</p> 
    <p>Consider:&nbsp; A CD ROM has a diameter of 120mm.&nbsp; <b>So 40 million CDs, if placed side-by-side, would be 4,800 km (2,983 miles)</b>.&nbsp; That is a distance we can think about and visualize better than the abstract &quot;40 million downloads&quot;.</p> 
    <p>Imagine a road trip from Los Angeles to New York City. It is only 2,789 miles, less than 40 million OpenOffice CDs would stretch:</p></span><span class="st">

  <p> </p> 
  <p>Or, in Europe, imagine a trip from Lisbon to Moscow.&nbsp; That is 4,575 km, less than our Apache OpenOffice downloads would stretch:</p> 
  <p><br /></p> 
  <div align="center"><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Lisbon,+Portugal&amp;daddr=Moscow,+Russia&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.904456,-96.124051&amp;sspn=26.56465,67.631836&amp;geocode=FbPmTgIdrGF0_yk78-RhGjMZDTHQNpDkvesABA%3BFQ6sUgMdgBc-AinJsNRz_Eq1RjFMz1dXzNZEPQ&amp;oq=mosc&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=5"><img alt="Lisbon to Moscow" src="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/235cd412-42e3-43bb-8c9b-27482c158481" /></a></div> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Or try Istanbul to Islamabad.&nbsp; That is 4,963 km, just a little longer than the CDs would reach:</p> 
  <p><br /></p> 
  <p align="center"><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Istanbul,+Turkey&amp;daddr=Islamabad,+Pakistan&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=37.335224,51.020508&amp;spn=26.757286,67.631836&amp;sll=48.253941,33.310547&amp;sspn=22.527318,67.631836&amp;geocode=FdawcQIdQCe6ASlrCGgABKfKFDHQsAG8mP7M4Q%3BFYd_AgIdw9BaBCkvcpF40L_fODG2Ats7XFFZYA&amp;oq=islam&amp;mra=ls&amp;t=m&amp;z=5"><img alt="Istanbul to Iislamabad.jpg" src="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/c9fcfddb-e466-4b1c-a6a9-6c61216f60fa" /></a> </p> 
  <p>Consider the CD ROM once more.&nbsp; Its thickness is 1.2mm.&nbsp; So if we stacked the 40 million CDs (very carefully!) they would be 48 km high, longer than a marathon, 100x taller than the Empire State Building, 5x taller than Mt. Everest, and higher even than  Felix Baumgartner's record-breaking skydiving jump.<br /></p> 
  <p>Of course these are all fun statistics, but our users are much more than just numbers.&nbsp; They are students, teachers, doctors, lawyers, ministers, public servants, and business people from all industries.&nbsp; Many of them choose to engage further with the project, by following us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApacheOO">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApacheOO">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://plus.google.com/+openoffice">Google+</a>, by posting questions on our <a href="http://forum.openoffice.org/">support forums</a>, or by <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">volunteering to help</a> the project in areas such as <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/intro-doc.html">Documentation</a>, <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/intro-qa.html">QA</a>, <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/intro-marketing.html">Marketing</a> or <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/translate.html">Translation</a>.&nbsp; We're happy to welcome new volunteers at any time and look forward to serving many millions of users more in the coming months and years.</p>
