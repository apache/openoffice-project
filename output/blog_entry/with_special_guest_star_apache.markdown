<p align="left">Viewers of the hit ABC sitcom <i>Suburgatory </i>may have noticed something special in the season 2 finale last night, in an episode called &quot;Apocalypse Meow&quot;.&nbsp; Lead character Tessa (played by Jane Levy) used the free, open source office productivity software <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> on her Mac, to outline the pros and cons of getting revenge on her nemesis Dalia:<br /></p>

  <p>Those with access (and this may have geo-based access restrictions) can see scene starting at the 8:50 mark on <a href="http://abc.go.com/watch/suburgatory/SH55126593/VDKA0_2durzflg/apocalypse-meow">ABC's online version of the episode</a>. </p> 
  <p>This is an example of &quot;stage dressing&quot;.&nbsp; The designer in a play, movie or television show has a particular &quot;look&quot; in mind, to bring life to the script.&nbsp; The designer then works with the properties&nbsp; directory to provision the right props.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of it is physical stuff, like furniture, lamps or other similar items.&nbsp; But contemporary shows, with characters interacting with technology, also use a digital form of stage dressing.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>Here's another example, from Roman Polanski's 2011 comedy <i>Carnage</i>:</p>

  <p>The Apache OpenOffice project has received several requests to use our 
product in this way, in movies and in US and UK television programs. Why use OpenOffice in such situations?&nbsp; One guess is that securing rights to use open source software like Apache OpenOffice is easier than getting rights for commercial products.&nbsp; Another guess is that using open source avoids potential conflicts with advertisers who are selling competing products.&nbsp; And another guess is that they avoid showing commercial products unless they are paid for placement.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really know.&nbsp; But in any case we're pleased to see open source software, and especially Apache OpenOffice, featured in the media. <br /></p>
