  <p>Welcome to the first edition of Apache OpenOffice Weekly News.&nbsp; We're experimenting with a new way to give the OpenOffice community a look into the project and what we're doing week-to-week.&nbsp; We saw another Apache project,&nbsp; CouchDB, do <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/couchdb/entry/couchdb_weekly_news_april_3%20From%20ApacheCon">something similar</a>,&nbsp; and liked their approach.&nbsp; So in the open source tradition, we're going to borrow their idea.</p> 
  <p>The exact format and timing of Apache OpenOffice Weekly News will likely change as we gain more experience with it, and based on your feedback.</p> 
  <p>Speaking of which, we welcome your feedback.&nbsp; You can respond with a comment on this blog post, of course.&nbsp; You can also send an email to our public mailing list: <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org</a>. <br /></p>
