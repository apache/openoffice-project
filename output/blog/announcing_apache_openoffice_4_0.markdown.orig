The Apache OpenOffice project (formerly OpenOffice.org) is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apache 4.0.1.&nbsp; Building upon the success of our <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/119867/bossie-awards-2013-the-best-open-source-desktop-and-mobile-software-226979#slide8">award-winning</a> Apache OpenOffice 4.0 release, which was well-received by both users and reviewers, the 4.0.1 maintenance update brings new translations, performance enhancements and bug fixes.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>You can download OpenOffice 4.0.1 from our <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>New translations introduced in this release are:&nbsp; Basque,&nbsp; 
 Khmer, 
 Lithuanian,

 Polish, 
Serbian Cyrillic, 
  Swedish,
     Traditional Chinese, 
Turkish and 
    Vietnamese. &nbsp; It is an important part of our <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mission.html">Public Service Mission</a> to support, with help from our translation volunteers, minority and regional languages that are typically ignored by commercial vendors.&nbsp;&nbsp; We now ship OpenOffice in 32 languages.&nbsp; <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/translate.html">With your help</a> we could support many more.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>This update also includes many bug fixes, including performance fixes.&nbsp; For example, one common scenario saving Microsoft Excel files was sped up 230%.&nbsp;&nbsp; A repaint issue reported by several 4.0.0 users was fixed.&nbsp; In general the most common issues reported by 4.0.0 users are fixed in this update.&nbsp; A full list of changes can be found in the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.0.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>In parallel with work on 4.0.1 the project has also been working on 4.1.0 items.&nbsp; Although no date has been set for this release, areas of focus include:&nbsp; improved interoperability with Microsoft Office, integration of IAccesible2 accessibility support, and (of course) new translations and bug fixes.<br /></p>
