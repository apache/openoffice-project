## Apache OpenOffice Public Mailing Lists

We welcome you to join our mailing lists and let us know about your thoughts or
ideas about Apache OpenOffice.

Note: These are public mailing lists and anything posted to these lists is archived
and is visible to the public, indexed by search engines, etc. Posts can only
be removed in extraordinary circumstances, in accordance with Apache's [Public Forum
Archive Policy](http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html)

## Using Mailing Lists

A mailing list is a way to share information and coordinate with other project members.
When you send an e-mail to a mailing list it is forwarded to all other subscribers to
that mailing list.

Every OpenOffice mailing list has a list address, of the form:
*xyz*@openoffice.apache.org, where you **replace "*xyz*" with the actual list name**,
such as "dev" or "qa" or "marketing".

### Basic Operations

There are three basic operations you should know about:

- To *send* an e-mail to the mailing list, and have it forwarded to all other
  subscribers, send an e-mail to the list's address, *xyz*@openoffice.apache.org.
- To *subscribe* to the mailing list, so you start receiving all posts to the mailing
  list, send an e-mail to *xyz*-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org. You will then receive a
  confirmation e-mail. Once you respond to the confirmation e-mail you are subscribed.
  Please keep the initial e-mail you receive from *xyz*-help@openoffice.apache.org as it
  contains helpful information you may need in the future.
- To *unsubscribe* from the mailing list, so you stop receiving all posts to the
  mailing list, send an e-mail to *xyz*-unsubscribe@openoffice.apache.org. You will then
  receive a confirmation e-mail. Once you respond to the confirmation e-mail you are
  unsubscribed.

NOTE: Please do not send subscribe/unsubscribe requests to the mailing list itself
(*xyz*@openoffice.apache.org). You must send these requests to the special
*xyz*-subscribe and *xyz*-unsubscribe addresses.

### List Moderators
Each mailing list at OpenOffice has at least two human moderators. If you need
additional help with a mailing list in any way including reporting inappropriate
behavior, you can e-mail the list moderator at *xyz*-owner@openoffice.apache.org where
*xyz* is a list name. Example: qa-owner@openoffice.apache.org.


## Participation Guidelines
We ask all mailing list participants to observe [these conduct guidelines][1].

Specifically note the request "Use sensible and concise e-mail subject headings". On our
high-traffic lists, especially dev, we encourage the use of e-mail subject tags that
indicate the topic of your post. Consistent use of such tags makes it more likely that
your post will be read by subscribers most interested in that topic. It also faciliates
sorting and filtering by e-mail inbox rules.

Some subject tags often seen on dev include:

- [www] for posts related to the website
- [Repo] for posts related to the source code repository
- [download] for posts related to the release download and mirroring infrastruture
- [API] for posts related to API specific topics
- [EXT] for posts related to Extension specific topics

Other useful topic tags can be found by observing traffic on the list or by looking at
the list archives.

In addition to the topic subject tags, there are also tags used to indicate a request:

- [DISCUSS] indicates a rough idea is being floated, and input is welcome
- [PROPOSAL] indicates a specific proposal is being made, and often that Lazy
Consensus is being sought.
- [VOTE] indicates that a formal vote is being called. This is rare.

Note: it is common for a topic tag and an action tag to be combined, e.g.:

- [PROPOSAL][Repo] Migration of legacy repository to SVN
- [DISCUSS][download] What are our options of mirroring legacy releases?

Finally, please keep in mind that all of the above mailing lists are public
and any post you make will likely be archived by a variety of services. The Apache
policy for expunging posts can be found
[here](http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html) but this will only apply
to Apache mail archives, not archives from other services such as Gmane or Markmail.
