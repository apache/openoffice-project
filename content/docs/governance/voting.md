Title:     Voting
Notice: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Occasionally a "feel" for consensus is not enough. Sometimes we need to have a
measurable consensus. For example, when voting in new committers or to approve a
release. 

## Preparing for a Vote

Before calling a vote it is important to ensure that the community is given time to
discuss the upcoming vote. This will be done by posting an email to the list
indicating the intention to call a vote and the options available. By the time a
vote is called there should already be [consensus in the community][1]. The vote 
itself is, normally, a formality.

## Calling a Vote

Once it is time to call the vote a mail is posted with a subject starting with
"[VOTE]". This enables the community members to ensure they do not miss an important
vote thread. It also indicates that this is not consensus building but a formal
vote. The initiator is responsible for the vote. That means also to count the votes
and present the results. Everyone has 1 vote.

### Casting Your Vote

The notation used in voting is:

**+1** (means I vote positive) -- You can say why you vote positive but it's not a must-have.

**0** (means vote abstention and nothing else)

**-1** (means I vote negative because of the following reason)
You must support your objection and provide an alternative course of action
that you are willing and able to implement (where appropriate).

#### Example for a vote mail:

    Address: private@
    Subject: [VOTE] Jan Doe should become a regular committer
    
    Text:
    "I would like to propose to vote in Jan Doe as committer. Jan has showed in
    the last months that they have the skills and oversight for improving things (think
    about the last UI change of the "Find" dialog)."
    
    +1 (means I vote for Jan)
     0 (means vote abstention)
    -1 (means I vote against Jan because of the following reason:
