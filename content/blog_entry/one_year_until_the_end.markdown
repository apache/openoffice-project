      <h2 id="the-april-2014-deadline">The April 2014 deadline</h2> 
      <p>Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/endofsupport.aspx">announced</a>
 that they will end support of Office 2003 and Windows XP on April 
8th, 2014.  What does this mean?  As they describe,
&quot;After April 8, 2014, there will be no new security updates, 
non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options or online 
technical content updates.&quot;  This,
according to Microsoft, exposes Office 2003 users to greater &quot;Security 
&amp; Compliance Risks&quot;.</p> 
      <h2 id="exploring-the-alternatives">Time to explore the alternatives</h2> 
      <p>Some companies and users will write a big check to Microsoft for an upgraded license for Office.  But 
others will see this as an opportunity 
to explore the alternatives, including open source products like <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache 
OpenOffice</a>, the leading free productivity suite, with over 44 million downloads.&nbsp;  Now is a good time to start planning for a migration off 
of Microsoft Office 2003 and Windows XP.  Many companies have already 
started.</p>
      <p>Apache OpenOffice is available on Windows, MacOS and Linux.&nbsp; It is open source software, which means there are no license or subscription fees required to use or redistribute OpenOffice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p> 
      <p>You can learn more about Apache OpenOffice at <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">www.openoffice.org</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many companies offer migration services for Apache OpenOffice, some of which are listed on our <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/bizdev/consultants.html">consultants page</a>.<br /></p>
