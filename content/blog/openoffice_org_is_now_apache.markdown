<p>If you <a href="http://download.openoffice.org">download Apache OpenOffice 3.4</a>, or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">browse our website</a>, you will notice that we have a rebranding effort underway. &nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to offer a few thoughts on what happened, why and what will be coming next.</p> 
  <p>When the OpenOffice.org project came to Apache, it started in the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a>, where all projects new to Apache start.&nbsp; Here we worked on various tasks to integrate the project into Apache, from licensing, policy, process and cultural perspectives. &nbsp;&nbsp; Previous posts have discussed the <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/an_apache_openoffice_timeline">site migration</a> work and the <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/what_is_a_podling">IP review/cleanup</a> tasks.&nbsp; Another task for the community was to adapt to the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs.html">Apache branding policy</a>.</p> 
  <p>Apache projects, under the umbrella of the Apache Software Foundation, share a common website, a common license, and are part of a common larger community of developers and users.&nbsp; To reinforce this, all Apache projects, and their products, use the naming pattern &quot;Apache ___&quot;, such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Subversion, Apache POI, etc.</p> 
  <p>Possible conforming names that the community discussed and considered included:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Apache Open Office</li> 
    <li>Apache OpenOffice</li> 
    <li>Apache OpenOffice.org</li> 
    <li>Apache ODF Office<br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>&nbsp;A vote was held, and &quot;Apache OpenOffice&quot; won.&nbsp; A new logo, based on a design by Michael Acevedo, was selected, and that is what you see our website now.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" bgcolor="#ffffff" align="center"> 
    <tbody> 
      <tr> 
        <td>Former OpenOffice.org logo</td> 
        <td> 
          <p align="center"><img width="200" height="100" src="http://www.openoffice.org/images/ooo-logo.png" /> </p> 
        </td> 
      </tr> 
      <tr> 
        <td>New Apache OpenOffice logo<br /></td> 
        <td> 
          <p align="center"><img width="200" height="100" src="http://www.openoffice.org/images/AOO_logos/OOo_Website_v2_copy.png" /> </p> 
        </td> 
      </tr> 
    </tbody> 
  </table> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>Updating the website and the code to use this new branding will take some time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apache OpenOffice 3.4 release, for example, still has some places where it refers to &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot;.&nbsp; We hope to have this rebranding completed in our next major release.</p> 
  <p>Note: You will still continue to see references to OpenOffice.org in the context of older release.&nbsp; For version 3.3.0 and earlier it is still proper to refer to them as OpenOffice.org, since they are pre-Apache.&nbsp; But all new work at Apache will use the name Apache OpenOffice.<br /></p> 
  <p><br /></p>
