  <p>The ApacheCon Europe 2012 team has opened the <a href="http://s.apache.org/mx">Call for Papers</a>. Deadline for submission is August 13th. This year the conference will be held in Sinsheim, Germany from November 5 - 9. Check out the conference site here: http://www.apachecon.eu/<br /></p>The Apache OpenOffice project team is planning to build a dedicated stream of sessions. Think of this as a &quot;Conference-Within-a-Conference&quot; where we will focus on everything related to Apache OpenOffice. <br /><br />We invite you to submit proposals for talks, for technical sessions focused on the core components: Writer, Calc, Impress, Math, Base and Draw. Equally important topics include: Programmability, Extensions, User Experience Design, Performance, Quality Engineering, Translation, Support, Website, Documentation and Community.<br /><br />If your experience and expertise falls more in the business side of things, please submit proposals for sessions where you can share experiences deploying Apache OpenOffice. Case studies for Apache OpenOffice adoption in government, industry and educational environments are most welcome.<br /><br />In addition to the formal talks, there will be hackathon rooms, meetups and evening sessions. <br /><br />For more background information please have a look at our <a href="http://s.apache.org/4cp">project planning wiki</a>. The plan will evolve and depend on everyone contributing and bringing the best of their knowledge and expertise to ApacheCon Europe. <br /><br />You are cordially invited to <a href="http://www.apachecon.eu/cfp/">submit a proposal</a> for a talk. Community is our strength. This is your opportunity to share and shine.
