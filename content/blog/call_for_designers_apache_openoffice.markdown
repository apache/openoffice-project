<p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> is looking for a refreshed logo and branding for its upcoming 4.0 release.</p> 
  <p><img align="middle" src="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/mediaresource/19b19fa0-f51b-4c42-aa7d-ceb8d0d9aa62" alt="logo-contest-600.png" /><br /> </p> 
  <p>This is a tremendous opportunity for designers to get involved in one of the most popular free and open source projects, and to get their work displayed to dozens of million of users: Apache OpenOffice just celebrated 40 million downloads in less than ten months.</p> 
  <h3>Brand Refresh Project Scope</h3> 
  <p>Required:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>An AOO Logo</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Considerations:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Can be altered for use in splash screens, about screens, publications, website, elements in application icons, etc.</li> 
    <li>Brand proposals that show more than just a logo, considering placement in the areas of focus such as splash screen and websites.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Primary Requirements</h3> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Logo submissions must include the source.</li> 
    <li>Logos can be as large as the designer wishes, but must be able to 
scale down and not loose detail. eg.. for website, splash screen, etc.</li> 
    <li>Although text in the logo is optional, any font used must be a free
 and open font. eg. SIL Open Source Fonts.&nbsp; Any font used in the logo 
must be disclosed upon submission.</li> 
    <li>Incorporation of gulls literally or symbolically, but not necessarily the existing shape used in current branding.</li> 
  </ul>
