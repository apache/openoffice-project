<p>IF YOU HAVE AN OPENOFFCE.ORG EMAIL ADDRESS, PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE</p> 
  <h3><a name="(Draft)PublicStatementonEmailForwarding-Background"></a>Background</h3> 
  <p>As you may have heard, Oracle contributed the OpenOffice.org (OOo)&nbsp; 
code to Apache in June. As part of this move, we will lose access to the
 servers that formally hosted the OpenOffice.org website and various 
other online services associated with the project.&nbsp; Fortunately, the 
Apache OpenOffice project, working with the Apache Infrastructure Team, 
has been able to migrate most of these services to new servers, hosted 
by Apache.&nbsp; This includes critical services like version control,
 downloads, website, wiki, bug tracking, user forums, etc. However, the email
 forwarding service will not be among the services we preserve. The 
OpenOffice.org email forwarder will be terminated effective March 15th, 
2012.</p> 
  <h3><a name="(Draft)PublicStatementonEmailForwarding-Howthiswillimpactyou"></a>How this will impact you</h3> 
  <p>Starting on March 15th, 2012, emails sent to openoffice.org email 
addresses will stop forwarding.&nbsp; Senders will receive a bounce 
notification pointing them to an OpenOffice website with more 
information on the termination of openoffice.org email forwarding.&nbsp; No 
personal information about you will be shared with anyone. &nbsp; If the 
sender already knows an alternative way to contact you, then they might 
resend their email to an alternative email address, or contact you via 
other means.&nbsp; We cannot control this.&nbsp; Many emails are automated, and there is no human at 
the other end to react to such bounce notices.&nbsp; In those cases you will 
not receive the emails and may not even know that you have missed an 
email.&nbsp; So we recommend that you not rely on senders reacting to the 
bounce notification. Instead you should proactively reach out to correspondents 
to notify them that your email address is changing.</p> 
  <h3><a name="(Draft)PublicStatementonEmailForwarding-Whatyoushoulddo"></a>What you should do</h3> 
  <p>If you have an openoffice.org email address then you should take the following steps well in advance of March 15th, 2012:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Contact those with whom you have shared your openoffice email 
address and let them know to use a different address to contact you.</li> 
    <li>If you have subscribed to mailing lists using your openoffice.org 
address, then unsubscribe from your openoffice.org address and 
resubscribe with another address</li> 
    <li>If you have used your openoffice.org address as a registration 
address for an online service, then log in to that account and change 
your address.</li> 
    <li>If you list your openoffice.org email address on your webpage or in your profile page, then update that information.<br /></li> 
  </ul>
