<p>The Apache® OpenOffice® Project is on the road to a bigger update for 
the leading open source office suite.
<br>
<br>This is your chance. OpenOffice needs people to help in the development 
process. Don't panic, you do not need to be a software engineer or 
programmer though those skills are always welcome. You can already 
contribute a lot if you just install the software and test it for 
quality, reliability, language translations and submit bug reports, 
write documentation, and many other tasks as well.
<br>
<br>If this sounds like something that you would be interested in then join 
with many others from all over the world on our development mailing list 
by sending an e-mail to <a class="moz-txt-link-rfc2396E" href="mailto:dev-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">dev-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a> and join the fun (<a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html" target="_blank">more information about mailing lists</a>).
