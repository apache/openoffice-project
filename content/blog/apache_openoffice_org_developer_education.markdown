  <h2>&nbsp;Developer Education<br /></h2> 
  <p>It is September.&nbsp; In the northern hemisphere it is time for cooler weather and time to go back to school.&nbsp; The Apache OpenOffice.org podling is ready for the season with events to help developers learn more about OpenOffice.org.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>Do you want to learn how to build Apache OpenOffice.org on Linux?&nbsp; Do you want to take the first steps towards becoming an OpenOffice hacker?&nbsp; Do you want to help test, review and improve our build instructions, on any one of a variety of Linux distros?&nbsp; If so, you will not want to miss this event.<br /></p> 
  <p>Next week, from Wed September 7th through Saturday September 10th we will be making a concerted effort to enable everyone who wants to be able to build OpenOffice. This will be the first of a series of Developer Education topics we hope to deliver.&nbsp; Others may include how to build on Windows and Mac, and how to work on particular OpenOffice features.</p> 
  <p>This will be a virtual event, with collaboration on the ooo-dev mailing list and on IRC.&nbsp; Members of the OpenOffice.org podling will be on hand to help anyone who wishes to get started with OpenOffice development on Linux.</p> 
  <h2>&nbsp;How to Get Involved<br /></h2> 
  <p>There are a few things you should do to prepare for this event:</p> 
  <ol>
