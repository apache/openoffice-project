office software. It is loaded with tools; downloads and installs 
quickly; and handles all the basic functions you could need from an 
office suite.&quot;</p>

  <p>We
 received another report on the users mailing list from someone who had 
downloaded what he thought was OpenOffice, but instead got a bunch of 
malware.&nbsp; That wasn't us, obviously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apache OpenOffice does not bundle
 any other programs in its package.&nbsp; Absolutely none.&nbsp; Our downloads are
 carefully scanned for viruses and are accompanied by digital signatures
 and cryptographic hashes to allow users to verify their integrity.<br /><br />However,
 there are third parties that sometimes take OpenOffice and bundle it 
with objectionable and intrusive applications.&nbsp; In some cases they put 
up fake websites, or purchase advertisements in search engine search 
results, to lure people to their website.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that 
such sites often come top of the hit list on search engines; 
inexperienced users download from them and their computers become 
infected with adware/viruses/trojans. When we know the exact URL of any 
such sites we do our best to have these removed or flagged, but it is an
 uphill battle.<br /><br />We recommend to download only from<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download"> www.openoffice.org/download</a>
 which will redirect to SourceForge, whose secure content distribution 
network we use.&nbsp; A download from there will usually start within five 
seconds.<br /><br />Typically an OpenOffice download is about 145 MB; we do 
not use downloader applications, so any site offering a much smaller 
download should immediately be suspect. If in any doubt about a download
 it is best to check its integrity using MD5Sum; details are given at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums.html">http://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums.html</a><br /><br />OpenOffice is a complex and powerful software. If you have difficulties, our User Forums at&nbsp; <a href="https://forum.openoffice.org/">https://forum.openoffice.org/</a> in several languages will do their best to help.</p>
