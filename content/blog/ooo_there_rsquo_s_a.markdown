<p>The <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/openofficeorg.html">Apache OpenOffice.org (incubator)</a> project was born on Monday, June 13, 2011.&nbsp; Delivery was complicated.&nbsp; The baby’s doing fine.</p> 
  <p>Following the <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/statements-on-openofficeorg-contribution-to-apache-nasdaq-orcl-1521400.htm">June 1, 2011 announcement</a> of the license grant from Oracle to the Apache Software foundation, there was extensive discussion over the proposal for acceptance of OpenOffice.org as an Apache <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Incubation_Policy.html">incubator project</a>.&nbsp; Before the June 10 voting began, 207 edits had been made to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/OpenOfficeProposal">proposal</a>.&nbsp; Discussion leading up to the vote swamped the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201106.mbox/date">public mailing list</a> used for consideration and oversight of incubator projects.</p> 
  <p>We’re now taking the baby steps that will lead us to a healthy, thriving project:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>The open, public developers list, <font face="Courier New"><a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-ooo-dev/">ooo-dev</a></font>, is operating and active.&nbsp; Anyone can subscribe and post.&nbsp; Anyone can access the archive.  </li> 
    <li>There is a fledgling <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Wiki+Home">Community Wiki</a>.&nbsp; Anyone can subscribe and post.&nbsp; Anyone can access the wiki.  </li> 
    <li>There is also a <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOODEV/Wiki+Home">Developer Wiki</a>.&nbsp; Contributions here are treated as deliverables of the project.&nbsp; Anyone can access the wiki, but contributions to this wiki require submission of an <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas">Apache Contributor License Agreement</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps this wiki could have a better name?  </li> 
    <li>There is a <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/">project web site</a>.&nbsp; The content is rather thin at the moment.&nbsp; It is growing.  </li> 
    <li> 
      <div align="left">There’s also <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ooo/">a place</a> in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Apache Subversion</a> repository for all of the source code.&nbsp; At the moment that consists of tools and the project web site pages (created in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>).</div> 
    </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p align="left">The gathering of contributors for the project is continuing.&nbsp; In the status of many of the incubating podlings, you’ll find the OpenOffice.org <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/July2011">podling’s first check-up</a>.&nbsp; (Scroll down through the alphabetical list.)&nbsp; </p> 
  <p align="left">There is more to do, especially around migration of the sites and their artifacts from their OpenOffice.org homes to their Apache counterparts.&nbsp; There are more tasks to accomplish than the number already completed.</p> 
  <p align="left">Everyone wants to know how soon there will be another OpenOffice.org release and how rapidly everything can be up and running.&nbsp; So do we.&nbsp; Apache OpenOffice.org will be different.&nbsp; The differences may be unrecognizable, but they will be there.&nbsp; Establishing what it takes to reach a sustainable, supported release process as an Apache project is where we first begin by crawling, next to walk, and then to run</p> 
  <p align="left">This blog is a place for listening to the heartbeat and taking the pulse of the effort as it unfolds.</p>
