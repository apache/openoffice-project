  <p>It's time to write about new things that happen here in the Apache OpenOffice project.</p> 
  <p>At first, we want to let you know about new releases. The first will be the bugfix release 4.1.3 that will tie in directly with the current version. It's already in the cooking pot but needs some tasting and refinement before we will serve it. The next will then be the follow-up release 4.1.4 with further fixes.</p> 
  <p>When you now think <i>&quot;hm, only fixed bugs? Nice, but what about more&quot;</i> then please be patient. We are also planning a release afterwards with many more changes, including all new features developed in the last couple of years. As these aren't finally certain - number as well as size - even the version number isn't yet written in stone.</p> 
  <p>More news will follow. But this needs further blog posts.
