  <p>We're pleased to announce that the ASF Board, at their October monthly meeting, approved a resolution promoting the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> Podling to an Apache Top Level Project.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board also appointed a Project Management Committee (PMC) to oversee the project, with Andrea Pescetti as Chairman.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> </p> 
  <p>Further details on the graduation can be found in this <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces35">ASF Press Release</a>.&nbsp; Also available are translations into <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/it/stampa/comunicati/aoo-graduation.html">Italian</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/de/presse/pressemitteilung_20121018_Graduierung.html">German</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/fr/news/2012-10-graduation.html">French</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/ja/news/graduation.html">Japanese</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/es/noticias/graduacion.html">Spanish</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/zh-tw/news/graduation.html">Traditional</a> and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/zh-cn/news/graduation.html">Simplified</a> Chinese, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/da/graduation.html">Danish</a>, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/sk/news/aoo_graduation.html">Slovak </a>and <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/pt-br/news/aoo_gratuation.html">Brazilian Portuguese</a>.<br /></p> 
  <p>The members of the Project Management Committee, along with the many 
Committers and Contributors now look forward to continued success in
developing the award-winning Apache OpenOffice productivity 
applications.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>What does this mean for users of OpenOffice?&nbsp; In the near future there will be some changes to the website and mailing lists, as we move out of the Incubator.&nbsp; We're hoping to avoid any disruptive changes during this transition.&nbsp; <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Graduation+Infrastructure+Changes">Details of changes</a> will be posted on our wiki.&nbsp; But aside from these small administrative and infrastructure changes, work on the next release of Apache OpenOffice continues.&nbsp; And we all look forward to meeting in Sinsheim, Germany, in a few weeks for <a href="http://www.apachecon.eu/">ApacheCon Europe</a>!<br /></p>
