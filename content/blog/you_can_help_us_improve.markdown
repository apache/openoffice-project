  <h3>A Call for QA Volunteers <br /></h3> 
  <p>This is a call for volunteers for our QA team.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) project has an ambitious plan for our next major release.&nbsp; But for this plan to be successful we need to grow our Quality Assurance (QA) team to keep up with the output from our programmers.&nbsp; The more QA volunteers we have, the more bugs we can find and get fixed for Apache OpenOffice.&nbsp; This work has a direct impact on OpenOffice product quality.&nbsp; It is also fun!</p> 
  <h3>&nbsp;Why volunteer?<br /></h3> 
  <p>Why would you want to help with OpenOffice QA?&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>We're a fun, international group of testers, of a range of 
skills and experience, dedicated to free software and making OpenOffice a
 high quality choice for users.</li> 
    <li>This is a good way to learn about QA and get some practical 
experience.&nbsp; This is useful, for example, if you are thinking about 
Software Quality Engineering (SQE) as a possible career choice.</li> 
    <li>Helping as a tester is a good way to &quot;give back&quot; to the open 
source community in a way that makes a direct difference in the product,
 but doesn't require programming skills.</li> 
    <li>It is a good way to raise the visibility of bugs in areas that matter to you.&nbsp; For example, maybe you personally are 
concerned about bugs that cause problems on the Mac, or bugs that impact
 color blind users, or bugs related to bidirectional text.&nbsp; 
Participating on the QA team is a good way to ensure that areas of 
personal interest work right.<br /></li> 
    <li>We have tasks for volunteers with a range of skills.&nbsp; From 
novices who can help with manual testing and fix verifications, to 
experts who can help with our test automation framework, we have a full 
range of QA activities.</li> 
    <li>As an extremely popular open source product, with many millions 
of users, there are opportunities here to do some new and exciting 
things on the QA front.&nbsp; We're a laboratory for new ideas and approach to QA. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <h3>&nbsp;What does QA do?<br /></h3> 
  <p>QA activities within the Apache OpenOffice project include: 
  
  
  </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li> Reviewing incoming bug reports from users to see if the reported issues can be reproduced</li> 
    <li>Verifying bugs that the developers say they have fixed, to confirm that they actually have been fixed</li> 
    <li>Testing new builds of OpenOffice against a test plan</li> 
    <li>Defining new test cases</li> 
    <li>Running automated regression tests</li> 
    <li>Specialized tests in areas such as performance, accessibility, localization, security, etc.</li> 
    <li>Analyzing defect reports to see how we are doing, in terms of quality level, defect find and fix rates, etc.</li> 
    <li>Reporting summary defect data and recommending whether a given build of OpenOffice is ready to release.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> </p> 
  <h3>What are we looking for? <br /></h3> 
  <p>The skills we need on the QA team include: 
  </p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Familiarity with OpenOffice as a user.</li> 
    <li>Attention to detail.&nbsp; In QA we find the bugs that the developers missed.&nbsp; And our developers are pretty good.<br /></li> 
    <li>Access to a Windows, Mac or Linux machine for testing</li> 
    <li>Interest, enthusiasm and teamwork.</li> 
    <li>Also, specialized skills are always welcome, such as expertise in assistive technology tools, bidirectional scripts, East Asian text layout, power users of OpenOffice Base, etc.<br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>How to Get Involved</h3> 
  <p>You can start now, in three easy steps: <br /></p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>Subscribe to our public QA mailing list by sending an email to <a href="mailto:qa-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">qa-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a> and responding to the confirmation email you will then receive.</li> 
    <li>Introduce yourself on the list by sending&nbsp; an email to the QA mailing list:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:qa@openoffice.apache.org">qa@openoffice.apache.org</a></li> 
    <li>Review our self-paced <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/orientation/index.html">orientation modules</a> to help you get started.&nbsp; If you are already familiar with open source 
development at Apache, then you can quickly skim over the Level 1 and Level 2 modules and concentrate on the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/orientation/intro-qa.html">Introduction to QA</a> module.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, you are new to Apache, and want a more methodical approach to getting started, then you can start at Level 1 modules first.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>We hope to hear from you soon!<br /></p>
