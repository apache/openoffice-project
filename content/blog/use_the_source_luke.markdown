  <p>We take a lot of pride in the success of Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org, now undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at Apache).&nbsp; With over 100 million downloads, and a million more downloads every week, our award-winning, free and open office suite has grown and continues to grow in popularity. But this is not just a popularity contest.&nbsp; An enormous amount of public good comes from our work.&nbsp; We serve users that for-profit vendors often ignore, such as speakers of minority languages, or users in non-lucrative markets.&nbsp; We do this by publishing software, but also by helping users use it, and by encouraging a broader ecosystem of templates and extensions. &nbsp; <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/mission.html">The Public Service Mission of OpenOffice</a> describes in more detail the public good that our volunteers help create, in their work to support this user-centered ecosystem.<br /></p> 
  <p>The visible OpenOffice application, and its user-centered ecosystem, gets most of the public notice.&nbsp; This is natural for a product that is used by consumers, in a market of over one billion potential users.&nbsp; But behind the product that consumers see is a product that in many ways is even more important.&nbsp; This is the source code, the computer instructions that put &quot;source&quot; into &quot;open source&quot;.</p> 
  <p>The Apache OpenOffice source code consists of around 7 million lines of code.&nbsp; It is daunting at first, even for experienced programmers.&nbsp; But within this source code lies everything that OpenOffice does today, as well as the seeds of its enormous future potential.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>The community and extended ecosystem around this source code consists of:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Programmers who work directly in the Apache OpenOffice project, doing their primary coding for the project.</li> 
    <li>Developers who take the source code from our releases, or our version control system (where we store the code) and make their own products.&nbsp; Sometimes these are ports to <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/porting_apache_openoffice_to_solaris">other operating platforms</a>.&nbsp; In other cases they are repackaged versions,<a href="http://www.winpenpack.com/en/download.php?view.1341"> optimized for specific install scenarios</a> or <a href="https://www.rollapp.com/app/oocalc">runtime environments</a>. <br /></li> 
    <li>Developers of extensions.&nbsp; Like Apache HTTP Server and their <a href="https://modules.apache.org/">modules</a>,
OpenOffice has a powerful extensibility mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many 
developers can accomplish their tasks without making modifications to 
the core product.&nbsp; Our <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/">Extensions</a> website features many 3rd party extensions.<br /> </li> 
    <li>OpenOffice also supports end-user programming via templates and macro. &nbsp;&nbsp; Our <a href="http://templates.services.openoffice.org/">Templates</a> and <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/">Extensions</a> websites feature this user-contributed content.&nbsp; <br /></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>So yes, OpenOffice is free.&nbsp; You can download it and use it without charge.&nbsp; You can make copies and give them to your friends.&nbsp; As many copies as you want.&nbsp; But what makes OpenOffice truly open source is that it comes with the source code, which anyone can also download, modify freely and redistribute.&nbsp;
</p> 
  <p>Programmers interested in working with the source code to Apache OpenOffice will find <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/source.html">useful information</a> on our website.<br /></p>
