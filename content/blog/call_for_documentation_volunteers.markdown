  <p>As the Apache OpenOffice project gets closer to our big 4.0 release we're ramping up our documentation team.&nbsp; The goal is to have new User Guides ready for the OpenOffice 4.0 launch.&nbsp; If you know something about technical writing, or OpenOffice, or ideally both, we'd love your help.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>Of all the opportunities you have to volunteer your time for worthy causes, why should you consider volunteering with the Apache OpenOffice documentation team?&nbsp; A few thoughts on that: <br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>We're a fun, international group of volunteers, with a range of 
skills and experience, dedicated to free software and spreading the word
 about OpenOffice.</li> 
    <li>Helping with documentation is a good way to &quot;give back&quot; to the open 
source community, something that can be done without requiring special 
technical skills or large time commitments.<br /></li> 
    <li>Contributions are needed from volunteers with a range of experience levels and 
interests.  From authoring, to editing, technical verification, proof-reading, graphic design and tooling, we need volunteers in many disciplines.</li> 
    <li>This is a good way to learn more about technical writing and gain practical experience.</li> 
    <li>OpenOffice is among the most recognized open source brands, up there with Linux, Android and Firefox.  Your 
contributions to our efforts will potentially be seen by millions of users.</li> 
  </ul>
