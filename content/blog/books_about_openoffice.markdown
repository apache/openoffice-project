As the leading open source office productivity suite for over a decade, it is not surprising that Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) has attracted attention from authors of technical instruction books.&nbsp; A search of the catalog of online book retailers shows many titles, including a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Open-Office-Basic-James-Steinberg/dp/1481270931">new one on OpenOffice Basic</a> from as recently as a few weeks ago.</p> 
  <p>We encourage books to be written about Apache OpenOffice.&nbsp; This is good for the ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp; We keep a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/support/books.html">list of known books about OpenOffice</a> on our website.&nbsp; If you know of a book that we are missing, be sure to let us know via our<a href="mailto:marketing@openoffice.apache.org"> marketing mailing list</a>.</p> 
  <p>Also, authors and publishers of books related to OpenOffice are encouraged to contact us (via the above marketing mailing list).&nbsp;&nbsp; We can help in several ways.&nbsp; For example, we can answer any technical questions you might have about OpenOffice.&nbsp; We can also answer any of your questions regarding <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/trademarks.html">the use of Apache OpenOffice trademarks</a> in your book. We're also interested in doing interviews with authors for this blog.&nbsp; Again, contact the <a href="mailto:marketing@openoffice.apache.org">marketing mailing list</a> for more information.<br /></p>
