<p>We received the following mail from Mr. Ziegler on the developer mailing list [1] and we want to share it with all of you:<br /></p> 
  <p>Quote start<br /></p> 
  <p><i>I was encouraged to leave my aoo forum post directly in the dev mailing 
list so that you all can read what I wanted to express. I am not a 
software developper in any sense--only a user.
<br /><br />Dear developers,
</i> <i><br />there may be little positive feedback for your work, I guess. So I 
created an account for the forum (and now subscribed temporarily to 
dev@aoo) to leave a big THANK YOU!
<br /><br />The&nbsp; first version I used must have been something like StarOffice 
4.3, the&nbsp; first I owned was SO 5.2, and then I shifted to 
OpenOffice(.org) when it&nbsp; introduced the XML file formats. So I am a 
convinced and longterm user&nbsp; since then and hardly ever regretted my 
decision.
</i> <i><br /><br />OpenOffice&nbsp; gave me the possibility to mostly do what I wanted to 
(with writer,&nbsp; base, calc, impress and draw - in that historic order) in
 an efficient&nbsp; way, and the only thing I don't like is, that it always 
tends towards following&nbsp; MS Office although it already was better in 
many ways. I understand that it is&nbsp; crucial to get as many users as 
possible, so I acknowledge the decisions&nbsp; towards MS Office.
</i> <i><br /><br />What I like most is the long term usability&nbsp; and stability, and I do
 not only keep my office files from more than 10&nbsp; years ago, I also use 
and re-use them. And if one crashed in the past, I nearly&nbsp; always could 
recover them by opening the zip bundle with an (hex) editor.
</i> <i><br /><br />By that, I&nbsp; enjoyed the progress in LibreOffice, but didn't really 
need it. Although&nbsp; I switched to LibreOffice on some machines, I am 
always glad that there&nbsp; is OpenOffice, too. In my eyes, it is the more 
stable and efficient&nbsp; branch of the project. This year it was my 
fallback tool and salvation&nbsp; in a book project that I started with LO 
Writer;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first invested hours to get my pictures back to the place 
they&nbsp; belonged to when they got more and more (as others did decades 
before&nbsp; with MS Word) and then had to give up as it didn't open the file
 anymore&nbsp; without crashing. Apache OpenOffice (standard and portable) 
solved the problem. It got a nice book, by&nbsp; the way, for our church 
jubilee.
</i> <i><br /><br />So if you get the software&nbsp; maintained, I will probably continue to 
use OpenOffice for another 20&nbsp; years. And I won't switch to DTP software
 (Scribus) for the next book&nbsp; project neither like I regularly do for 
magazines, brochures etc.
</i> <i><br /><br />OpenOffice is a great, great software, even if it didn't evolve much
 in the last years! (maybe even: because..)&nbsp;&nbsp; Powerful enough for both 
private and standard business use.
</i> <i><br /><br />Keep patience and persistance!
</i> <i><br /><br />A very satisfied and content user </i> </p>
