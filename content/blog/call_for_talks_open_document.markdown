FOSDEM 15 will be held at the ULB Campus Solbosch on Saturday, January
31, and Sunday, February 1st, 2015.
<br /> <br />Open document editors are coming again to FOSDEM with a shared devroom which gives every project in this area a chance to present ODF related
developments and innovations. The devroom is jointly organized by Apache
OpenOffice and LibreOffice.
<br /> <br />We invite submission of talks for the Open Document Editors devroom, to
be held on Saturday, January 31, from 10AM to 6PM.
<br /> <br />Length of talks should be limited to 20 minutes, as we would like to
have questions after each presentation, and to fit as many presenters as
possible in the schedule. Exceptions must be explicitly requested and
justified.
<br /> <br />Technical talks (code, extensions, localization, QA, tools and adoption
related cases) about open document editors or the ODF document format
are welcome.
<br /> <br />Submissions must be done by the speakers using the Pentabarf system:
<br /><a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15">https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM15</a> <br /> <br />While filing your proposal, please provide the title of your talk, a
short abstract (one or two paragraphs), some information about yourself
(name, bio and photo, but please do remember that your profile might be
already stored at Pentabarf) and specify what topic (Apache OpenOffice,
LibreOffice, other ODF editors, ODF in general...) your talk is about.
<br /> <br />You do not need to create a new account if you already have one. If the
password has been lost, you can easily recover it.
<br /> <br />The deadline is <b>Sunday, December 14, 2014</b>. Accepted speakers will be
notified by December 28, 2014.
<br /> <br />You can send any questions to the devroom mailing list:
