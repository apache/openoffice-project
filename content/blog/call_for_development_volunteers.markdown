  <p>We're looking for a few good programmers, C++ hackers who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>The Apache OpenOffice project is an international, volunteer-led open source project.&nbsp; We develop Apache OpenOffice (formerly OpenOffice.org) the award-winning office productivity suite, and the code we write is used by tens of millions of users in over 200 countries.&nbsp; Not many open source projects have this reach. Not many commercial products have this reach either.</p> 
  <p>We have coding tasks, large and small, easy and difficult.&nbsp; Our developers, some with over a decade's experience with OpenOffice, can help you get started.&nbsp; We'd also love to hear what ideas <b>you</b> might want to bring to OpenOffice.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>If this sounds interesting and you want to learn more, we have some resources to help you do that:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Our &quot;<a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">Get Involved</a>&quot; page has an overview of our volunteer opportunities.&nbsp; We welcome volunteers in other disciplines as well, QA, documentation, marketing, support, etc.</li> 
    <li>Our &quot;<a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/index.html">New Volunteer Orientation</a>&quot; modules help new volunteers understand how the project works.&nbsp; The &quot;<a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/intro-development.html">Introduction to Development</a>&quot; module is the key one for coders.</li> 
    <li>Questions can be sent to our development mailing list, <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org.</a> </li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>We hope to hear from you soon!<br /></p>
