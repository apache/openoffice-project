Cheers to the community on the successful release of Apache OpenOffice 4.0.&nbsp; Full details of release can be found in our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.0+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.&nbsp; You can download Apache OpenOffice 4.0 <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">here</a>.<br /></p> 
  <p>This was a major release and a major effort for the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Directory+of+Volunteers">many volunteers</a> who worked on coding, testing, translation, support, marketing, documentation and other aspects of the project.&nbsp; And thanks are due to ongoing support from other parts of the Apache Software Foundation, especially the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/infrastructure.html">Apache Infrastructure Team</a> for their outsized effort to support our outsized project.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>It is summertime, at least for volunteers in the northern hemisphere,&nbsp; and August is vacation time.&nbsp; Many of us will be taking a break and enjoying time with friends and family.&nbsp; But then we'll be back and working at full force, with a focus on: <br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Bringing additional language translations to AOO 4.0.&nbsp; There are quite a few languages that are &quot;almost done&quot;, but did not make it into this release.&nbsp; But rather than wait until 4.1 we'll release these languages, in batches, as they become available.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tentatively we're aiming for mid-September for the first batch.&nbsp; If you want to help with a particular translation, we'd <a href="mailto:L10N@openoffice.apache.org">love to hear from you</a>.<br /></li> 
    <li>Apache OpenOffice 4.1.&nbsp; We've jotted down some <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+4.1+Release+Planning">proposed ideas</a> on our wiki.&nbsp; We now need to turn that into a plan, ideally for a 4.1 release at the end of 2013.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Finally, as we transition from one major release to another, this is a great time for new volunteers in all areas to join the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested helping us make the next great version of OpenOffice, then 
we want to hear from you.&nbsp; We're not only programmers, but are a 
community of testers, UI designers, web designers, technical writers, 
accessibility experts, translators, social media experts, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Volunteers in all areas are welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp; More information can be found on
