  <p>I'm always impressed by the enthusiasm of OpenOffice users to try out the next great release.&nbsp; A frequent question is, &quot;When will it be released?&quot;&nbsp; I see this question on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ApacheOO">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/apacheoo">Twitter</a>, the <a href="http://forum.openoffice.org/">Forums</a> and <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#using-mailing-lists">mailing lists</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When will version &lt;insert next version&gt; of OpenOffice be ready?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to answer the question fully here, so we can refer users to this answer in the future.</p> 
  <p>It is tempting to give the response, &quot;It will be released when it is ready&quot;.&nbsp; But that sounds a bit snarky, although it is accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the truth is software engineering schedule estimation is notoriously difficult and predicting a specific date is a sure way of looking foolish later on.<br /></p> 
  <p>There is a well-known diagram in the software industry of a triangle, with the sides labeled: &quot;good&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot;, &quot;fast&quot; and with the title, &quot;Pick any Two&quot;.&nbsp; This expresses the ever-present trade-off between quality, cost and schedule.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>In commercial software development arbitrary dates can (sometimes) be met, by dropping quality (or features) or by adding resources to tasks (increasing costs).&nbsp; To some extent open source projects can also try to hit arbitrary dates by dropping quality.&nbsp; But unlike commercial endeavors open source projects don't have the same ability to add resources to recover a schedule slip.&nbsp; On the Apache OpenOffice project we are mainly volunteers, dedicating free time to the project, and that time varies according to school and holiday schedules and other personal needs.&nbsp; So we cannot stick to a schedule in the same way that a commercial software publisher can.</p> 
  <p>OpenOffice is a mature product and users expect it to just work.&nbsp; They are not looking for surprises.&nbsp; Users want to spend time doing their task, their
 work, their business.&nbsp; OpenOffice is a tool, a means to an end, and 
having a stable, familiar tool that gets the job done is golden.  There 
is little pleasure in getting a new hammer and screwdriver every month, with 
new bugs, except for the small minority of technologists who relish the challenge and risk of frequent updates.&nbsp; The rest of us have real work to do and don't want to worry about whether the feature that worked last week still works today.<br /></p> 
  <p>So generally, we've been aiming for two high-quality release of Apache OpenOffice per year, with a cycle that looks approximately like this: <br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>Brainstorm and discuss possible features.&nbsp; Even before version N is released we're discussing what will be included in version N+1.&nbsp; This includes specific new features, enhancements, new languages, bug fixes, etc.&nbsp; Much of this is tracked in our Bugzilla issue tracker (for bugs and enhancements) and on our mailing lists and wikis (for major features).&nbsp; The contents of the release are determined by the volunteers who do the work, based on their interests and motivations.&nbsp; These are discussed, documented on the wiki and become the goal for the next release.&nbsp; <br /></li> 
    <li>Development of the new features occurs, the coding often occurring in &quot;branches&quot; which are segregated areas in our Subversion version control system which help the developers to not step on each other's toes when stabilizing their code.</li> 
    <li>As features are completed they are &quot;merged into the trunk&quot;.&nbsp; We regularly build install sets from the trunk, so project participants can try the new features as soon as they are ready and give feedback.</li> 
    <li>Once all the feature work is done for a release, we translate and test. <br /></li> 
    <li>We iterate on testing and fixing bugs until we've eliminated all &quot;release blocking&quot; bugs and have something of sufficient quality to call a Release Candidate.&nbsp; We then vote on the Release Candidate, and if approved it becomes the new release.</li> 
  </ul>So rather than asking about dates, the smart question is to ask, &quot;Where in the release cycle are you now?&quot;.&nbsp; In the case of Apache OpenOffice 4.0, we're on that last step, finishing the translation and test work.&nbsp; How long that step will last will depend on how many bugs are found, how many of them are release blockers, and how long it takes to fix them.&nbsp; These are things that are not easy to predict.&nbsp; Again, it comes down to the old saying: good, cheap, fast -- pick any two.
