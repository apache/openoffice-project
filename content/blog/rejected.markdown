  <p>Apache OpenOffice 4.0 Release Candidate 1 (Build 9702) has been rejected.&nbsp; It was not good enough. Detlef, in our German-language community, first noted the crash two days ago, which was passed on to the developers by Regina.&nbsp; We immediately started further testing to narrow down the problem.</p> 
  <p>Samer, in Canada, independently reported the crash a few hours later.&nbsp; We then determined that the crash only occurred on Windows 8 64-bit systems.&nbsp; Rob, in the United States, then worked with Herbert, in Germany, to find out where in the code the problem was.&nbsp; After a few more emails and chats, we had a proposed fix to test.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>As community members in Germany and North America slept, Yuzhen was testing the fix in Beijing. And now, this morning, the fix is confirmed and we've agreed to produce a new Release Candidate.&nbsp; If the new Release Candidate is free of serious issues it will be released next week.<br /></p> 
  <p>This is how a global community of volunteers produce quality open source software.&nbsp; There are skills required -- technical and social -- to coordinate a fix like this.&nbsp; But it also requires something much more important:&nbsp; a dedication to quality.&nbsp; We know that OpenOffice is more than just another software tool for our users.&nbsp; It is how you do work, how you write and communicate.&nbsp; If OpenOffice crashes then your productivity crashes.&nbsp; </p> 
  <p>For Apache OpenOffice 4.0, over 20 QA volunteers executed 1,221 regression test cases on 5 operating systems.&nbsp; 495 reported issues are resolved in this release, including many bugs reported in earlier releases.<br /></p> 
  <p> We hope that you join us in encouraging these priorities.&nbsp; We look forward to presenting you a high-quality OpenOffice 4.0 really soon.&nbsp; Apache OpenOffice 4.0 is quality worth waiting for.</p> 
  <p>If you also have a passion for quality and attention to detail, then you might be interested in volunteering on our QA team.&nbsp; You can read more about volunteering with the Apache OpenOffice project on our <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">Get Involved</a> page.&nbsp;</p>
