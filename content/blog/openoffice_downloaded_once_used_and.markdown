<p> One major advantage of OpenOffice is that it is open source and that
 the license allows you to use and install it as often you want. Once you 
have downloaded OpenOffice you can share it with as many other people as you like or install it on as many computers as 
you need. No limits!

  The project likes to count downloads because high 
download numbers are our motivation and if you want they are the indirect payment
 for all the volunteers. But we are also happy if you share your 
download with many other people or inside your company. If you do so 
please share your success stories of bigger deployments with us and we 
are happy to share your experience via our blog here. Keep in mind that 
sharing your experience, your success with other users in the community 
is also one kind of contribution to help the eco-system around 
OpenOffice growing.
