  <p>Sometime last night the 5 millionth copy of <a href="http://download.openoffice.org">Apache OpenOffice 3.4</a> was downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 5 million downloads in 6 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; To put this in perspective, <a href="http://www.ssb.no/folkendrkv_en/">the population of Norway</a> just hit 5 million earlier this year.&nbsp; That's a lot of OpenOffice!</p> 
  <p>(Apache OpenOffice is currently undergoing
      Incubation at the Apache Software Foundation.) </p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>If you look at a <a href="http://people.apache.org/%7Erobweir/aoo-downloads.html">chart of our daily download numbers</a> you see that the download rate has increased in the past two weeks.&nbsp; This is caused by our recent enabling of the update notification server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Installations of the previous version of OpenOffice, version 3.3.0, check our servers once a week to see if a new version of OpenOffice is available.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we're now getting a mix of new installs and upgrade installs.</p> 
  <p>So what are we doing in the project other than counting download numbers?&nbsp; Quite a lot, in fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many are working on a 3.4.1 maintenance release.&nbsp;&nbsp; This release will focus on quality (bug fixes) rather than new features.&nbsp; It will also include new translations, likely including UK English, Finnish and Slovenian.&nbsp; Work on other translations is underway, based on volunteer interest, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_language">Uyghur</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're tracking the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/AOO+3.4.1+Feature+Planning">3.4.1 items</a> on the wiki, if you want to see the details.&nbsp; Tentative date for 3.4.1 is the end of July.</p> 
  <p>In parallel with the 3.4.1 maintenance branch we're also working on discussing how best to use the Symphony contribution from IBM.&nbsp; This code has <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Symphony_contribution">many bug fixes and UI enhancements</a> that could benefit OpenOffice users.&nbsp; Some of the bug fixes from Symphony have already made it into the 3.4.1 branch.&nbsp; For post-3.4.1, we are weighing two options: a slower, incremental merge of Symphony enhancements into OpenOffice, or more rapid rebasing of OpenOffice on top of Symphony.&nbsp; Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, as well its supporters.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>The Apache OpenOffice project welcomes new volunteers on these and other items.&nbsp; Developers are needed, of course, but also those interested in testing, technical writing, translation, web design, usability, marketing, event planning, system admins, etc.&nbsp; This is a large, high visibility project where we can really make an impact in the world, but also one that is non-bureaucratic and organizationally flat, where it is easy for newbies to fit in.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a great place to get started on an open source project.&nbsp; If you are <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/openofficeorg/get-involved.html">interested in volunteering</a>, you can send an email to our public mailing list, at <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">ooo-dev@incubator.apache.org.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduce yourself and tell us what you would be interested in doing.</p>
