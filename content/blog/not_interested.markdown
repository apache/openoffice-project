  <p>We get many emails, several per week, of individuals and companies wanting to &quot;do business&quot; with us.&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of it is obviously spam, but some of it is quite serious.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposals do not have bad intentions, though they are often incompatible with our status as a non-profit organization.&nbsp; We try to respond to these notes and in a respectful manner. <br /></p> 
  <p>In general, if you are offering us money in return for a favor, we're not interested. The Apache OpenOffice project operates as part of the non-profit Apache Software Foundation.&nbsp; We're publishing open source code for the public benefit.&nbsp; We must operate fairly, without giving special advantage (or disadvantage) to any 3rd party.&nbsp; <br /></p> 
  <p>Some specific things we're not interested in: <br /></p> 
  <ul> 
    <li>We're not interested in bundling your application with our install in return for money.&nbsp; But the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License</a> permits you to make and distribute your own bundle.<br /></li> 
    <li>We're not interested in endorsing your product.</li> 
    <li>We're not interested in adding a link to your website in return for you adding a link to ours.</li> 
    <li>We're not interested in taking your money in return for a special &quot;advisory&quot; role in the project.&nbsp; We're a meritocracy.&nbsp; Membership is not for sale.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>But make no mistake -- we're not antagonistic to businesses or commercial use of OpenOffice.&nbsp; In fact our license, the permissive Apache License, is one of the most <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/why/why_compliance.html">business-friendly licenses</a> around.&nbsp; We want you to use our code.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we cannot have &quot;partners&quot; in the same way that a for-profit corporation can. </p> 
  <p>Our lack of commercial entanglements with 3rd parties means that
 you can operate commercially without fear that your competitor has a &quot;special
 relationship&quot; with the project, giving them an unfair advantage. <br /></p> 
  <p>On the other hand, we do encourage things like:</p> 
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html#Paypal">Contributions to the Apache Software Foundation</a>, which benefit the ASF as a whole.&nbsp; Dozens of companies that sponsor the ASF are acknowledged on the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html">Thanks Page</a>.<br /></li> 
    <li><a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/contributing-code.html">Contributions of code</a> to the OpenOffice project, that helps us extend its capabilities.</li> 
    <li><a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#marketing-mailing-list-public">Send us</a> links to articles, news stories, tutorials, extensions, or other materials, related to OpenOffice.&nbsp; If it is good, relevant and non-spammy, then we might link to it.&nbsp; But we're never going to link to something purely for the sake of a link exchange.<br /></li> 
    <li>If you offer services related to OpenOffice, then we welcome your profile submission for our <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/bizdev/consultants.html">consultants listings</a>.</li> 
    <li>If you are doing something really interesting related to OpenOffice, maybe we'll interview you for an article on this blog.&nbsp; Stories related to what the broader ecosystem is doing are interesting to our readers. <br /></li> 
  </ul>
