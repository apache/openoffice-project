    <p align="left">Once again the Apache Software Foundation is a &quot;<a href="http://community.apache.org/gsoc.html">mentoring organization</a>&quot; in Google Summer of Code, and the Apache OpenOffice project looks forward to this year's program.&nbsp; </p> 
    <p align="left">We invite students looking to get their hands dirty with real-world code to consider submitting an GSoC application related to OpenOffice.&nbsp;</p> 
    <p align="left"> Why OpenOffice?</p> 
    <div align="left"> 
      <ul> 
        <li>We're one of the most famous open source projects around.&nbsp; Our latest release has had over 45 million downloads.&nbsp; The work you do with OpenOffice could be seen by millions of users.</li> 
        <li>We're a fun, international and diverse group of volunteers.&nbsp; Working with OpenOffice this summer will be fun.</li> 
        <li>The core code for OpenOffice is C++, but extensions can be written in Java, Python and Basic as well.&nbsp; We probably speak your language.</li> 
        <li>OpenOffice software is central to the daily work of its users, with text documents, spreadsheets and presentations.&nbsp; There are good opportunities to explore applications that connect OpenOffice to cutting-edge disciplines such as text analytics, natural language processing, social network analysis, the semantic web, etc.<br /></li> 
      </ul>

    <p align="left">We've posted some <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20COMDEV%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20gsoc2013%20AND%20text%20~%20%22openoffice%22">initial ideas</a>, suggested by our mentors.&nbsp; But don't feel limited to these ideas.&nbsp; If you want to work on a variation of one of these ideas, or an entirely different idea, let us know.&nbsp; If it is a good fit, and a mentor is able to work with you, then let us know.&nbsp; If you're passionate about something we want to hear about it.</p> 
    <p align="left">For more information, please take a look at the <a href="http://community.apache.org/gsoc.html">Apache-wide GSoC page</a> where many of your questions may be already answered.</p> 
    <p align="left">Finally, we highly encourage prospective applicants to engage early with the OpenOffice community on our <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#development-mailing-list-public">development mailing list</a>.<br /></p>
