<p>On Sep, 21st we have released Apache OpenOffice 4.1.7. Since then we had <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/4.1.7/stats/timeline?dates=2019-09-21+to+2019-10-21" target="_blank" title="Apache OpenOffice download statistics">1.6 million</a>
 download requests. And this is only for the newest release. There are 
more for other versions that the users download due to their special 
needs. And not included are the many others from news magazins - online 
or on CD/DVD.<br /></p> 
  <p>Another impressive number is: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/timeline?dates=2012-01-01+to+2019-10-21" target="_blank" title="Apache OpenOffce download statistics">294 million</a>. These are the downloads over all versions since 01st January, 2012.<br /></p> 
  <p>Also with this post we want to call your attention again to 2 important things:</p> 
  <ol> 
    <li>We strongly advise to download software only from its original 
source. Then you are on the safe side to avoid any viruses or malware. 
For Apache OpenOffice it is &quot;<a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/" target="_blank" title="Apache OpenOffice Official Download">https://www.openoffice.org/download/</a>&quot;.<br /><br /></li> 
    <li>You don't need a permission or even registration to use or copy 
Apache OpenOffice as it is free and open source software. So, no problem
 with license keys and fees and other restricting stuff that is wasting 
your lifetime.</li> 
  </ol>
