  <p>The <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> project is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1, the latest release of the free and open community-developed productivity suite.&nbsp; This maintenance release builds upon the success of Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0, which has been downloaded <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/stats/">over 12 million times</a> by users in 228 countries, and adds further language support, platform compatibility, performance enhancements and bug fixes.&nbsp; OpenOffice 3.4.1 can be downloaded now from <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/download/">http://www.openoffice.org/download/ </a>or by going to the the Help/Check for Updates dialog within OpenOffice 3.4 or 3.3.<br /></p> 
  <p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Apache OpenOffice</a> (formerly OpenOffice.org) is undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at Apache.<br /></p> 
  <p> Complete details for the contents of the 3.4.1 release can be found in the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/development/releases/3.4.1.html">release notes</a>.&nbsp; Highlights include: <br /></p>

  <ul></ul> 
  <h2>Future Releases and Invitation to Submit Ideas<br /></h2> 
  <p>In parallel with work on the Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 maintenance release, project members have also been working on changes for the 3.5 release.&nbsp; Areas of focus for 3.5 include: improved MS Office interoperability, performance, stability, usability and support of additional languages.&nbsp; We are targeting the first quarter of 2013 for Apache OpenOffice 3.5.0.</p> 
  <p>A major update, Apache OpenOffice 4.0, will follow, including additional features and improvements merged in from the the IBM Lotus Symphony code recently contributed to Apache.&nbsp; There is also opportunity in this release to think &quot;outside of the box&quot; and bring additional innovation.<br /></p> 
  <p>As a project we are starting to brainstorm about what could be possible in Apache OpenOffice 4.0.&nbsp; We invite OpenOffice users, community members and other interested parties to join us in this process, to help make version 4.0 the kind of radical success that version 1.0 was over a decade ago.&nbsp; We're using <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/">Google Moderator</a> to collect and rate ideas. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=2011d5">Please join us and share your ideas</a>.<br /></p>
