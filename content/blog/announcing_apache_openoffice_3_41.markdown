  <h2>Future Releases and Invitation to Submit Ideas<br /></h2> 
  <p>In parallel with work on the Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 maintenance release, project members have also been working on changes for the 3.5 release.&nbsp; Areas of focus for 3.5 include: improved MS Office interoperability, performance, stability, usability and support of additional languages.&nbsp; We are targeting the first quarter of 2013 for Apache OpenOffice 3.5.0.</p> 
  <p>A major update, Apache OpenOffice 4.0, will follow, including additional features and improvements merged in from the the IBM Lotus Symphony code recently contributed to Apache.&nbsp; There is also opportunity in this release to think &quot;outside of the box&quot; and bring additional innovation.<br /></p> 
  <p>As a project we are starting to brainstorm about what could be possible in Apache OpenOffice 4.0.&nbsp; We invite OpenOffice users, community members and other interested parties to join us in this process, to help make version 4.0 the kind of radical success that version 1.0 was over a decade ago.&nbsp; We're using <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/">Google Moderator</a> to collect and rate ideas. &nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=2011d5">Please join us and share your ideas</a>.<br /></p>
