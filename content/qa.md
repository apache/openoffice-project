## What is Quality Assurance (QA)?

[Quality assurance (QA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance) refers to the planned and systematic activities implemented in a quality system so that quality requirements for a product or service will be fulfilled.
QA doesn't require programming skills, so everyone can help us. If you are interested in doing QA, please join us.


## Talk to Us

 - We coordinate our work on the [QA mailing list](https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#qa-mailing-list-public).
Subscribe to this list if you want to follow our work.
 - We also have a [QA Wiki](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance) that we use for planning and documenting our process.


## How to Help

We welcome QA volunteers and have several ways to get started:

 - If you are familiar with both QA work and with Apache-style open source projects, then you can probably
jump right in. Join the [QA mailing list](https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#qa-mailing-list-public) and introduce yourself and we can help you get started.
 - If you are familiar with Apache or similar open source projects, but new to QA, then you can look at our [Orientation Modules](https://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/index.html).
You can skim over the first two levels, since much of this may be familiar. But spend more time on the 
[Introduction to QA](https://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/intro-qa.html) module.
 - If you are new to QA and to open source development, then you may also want to start with our
[Orientation Modules](https://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/index.html), and give attention 
to the Level 1 and Level 2 topics, as well as the Level 3 Introduction to QA.

In all cases, please join the [QA mailing list](https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#qa-mailing-list-public) and introduce yourself.
