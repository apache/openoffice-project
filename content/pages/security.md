## Reporting New Security Problems with Apache OpenOffice

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems with Apache OpenOffice.

We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

**Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache OpenOffice and managing
the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that
does not relate to an undisclosed security problem in Apache OpenOffice will be ignored.**

If you need to report a bug that isn't an undisclosed security vulnerability, please use the bug reporting page.

Questions about:

* how to configure OpenOffice securely
* if a vulnerability applies to your particular application
* obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* availability of patches and/or new releases

should be addressed to the project's main mailing list. Please see the mailing lists page for details of how to subscribe.

The primary *private* security mailing address is: [security@openoffice.apache.org](mailto:security@openoffice.apache.org)

Please note that we do not use a team OpenPGP key. If you wish to encrypt
your e-mail to the security list then please use the OpenPGP keys of the following
subset of members of the Apache OpenOffice Security Team and be aware that
it may take us a little longer to respond to the issue.
