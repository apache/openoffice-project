Title:     Use of the "Get it here!" logo
Notice: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Anyone, without additional permission from this project, may use the
following logo subject to the following conditions:

## The Logo:

<p> 
<a href="https://download.openoffice.org/">
<img width="300" height="100" alt="Download Apache OpenOffice here" 
src="https://openoffice.apache.org/images/get-it-here/en.png"/>
</a>
</p>

The logo file may be [found here][1].

If translations of the "Get it here!" text are required, send a request to the 
[dev mailing list][2] and we can make a translated version for you.

## Conditions:

1. The logo may be resized, so long as the aspect ratio is preserved and the logo
   remains legible, but the logo may not be otherwise altered.

1. The logo **must directly link** to one of:

   * The Apache OpenOffice [home page][3]
   * The download page for Apache OpenOffice, either the [main download page][4] or
     the [detailed download page][5].
   * One of the official Native Language pages at openoffice.org, e.g., 
     https://www.openoffice.org/de, https://www.openoffice.org/it, https://www.openoffice.org/fr, etc.

1. The logo **must not** link to a page at any other website other than openoffice.org.

1. The logo **must not** link to a specific download file or mirror.  This
   causes problems with load balancing and fallbacks and may prevent
   users from getting the latest version of Apache OpenOffice.  

1. Any use of this logo or any other Apache logo beyond the above 
   requires explicit permission per the existing [trademark policy][6]

## Example

This is an example of how the "Get it here!" logo might be included in an
HTML page:

```
    <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download">
    <img width="300" height="100" alt="Download Apache OpenOffice here" 
    src="https://openoffice.apache.org/images/get-it-here/en.png"/>
    </a>
```
