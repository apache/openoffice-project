Title:     How to Help Translate Apache OpenOffice
Notice: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

## Introduction

OpenOffice traditionally has always had excellent localization support,
especially with its support of over 100 languages, including many
minority languages that are not commonly supported in commercial
products. Our community-led, all-volunteer, open source development
model facilitates this.

Each new version of OpenOffice requires the translations to be
updated, to add translations for terms and phrases that have been
added or changed in the product. So maintaining support for any given
translation is an ongoing effort, requiring volunteers to help keep
the translations current, complete and accurate.

A list of complete, released, translations
available in the most recent release of Apache
OpenOffice can be found [here](https://www.openoffice.org/download/other.html).

A larger list of languages, including ones where translation work is
still ongoing, can be found [here](https://translate.apache.org/projects/aoo40/),
while the full list of available translations,
including incomplete and dormant ones, is available
[here](https://github.com/apache/openoffice/tree/trunk/extras/l10n/source).

## How to Help

First, subscribe to our localization ("L10N")
mailing list by sending an email to
[L10N-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org](mailto:L10N-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org);
you will receive a confirmation request, just reply to it to be subscribed.

If an OpenOffice build is [already available](https://www.openoffice.org/download/other.html)
in your language, you should download and
install it. If you find errors in the translation, you can report them
via bug reports in [Bugzilla](https://issues.apache.org/ooo/enter_bug.cgi?product=native-lang) 
or enter a suggested fix into Pootle (more on Pootle below). You can
contact the [L10n list](/mailing-lists.html#localization-mailing-list-public)
also for reporting errors in the English version.

If an OpenOffice build is not yet available for your language, then that typically
means that the translation is not yet complete. You can help finish
the translation by obtaining an account in
[Pootle](https://translate.apache.org/projects/aoo40/),
our online translation system.

Please refer to our comprehensive
[guide to the OpenOffice Pootle server](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Pootle_User_Guide)
to know how to request access to Pootle and
find useful tips for translators.

When you have completed the initial translation, send a note to the 
[L10n list](/mailing-lists.html#localization-mailing-list-public).
At that point we can make a special test build of Apache
OpenOffice for you to review. If more changes are required in the
translation, we can iterate on these steps, making changes, making new
test builds, etc.

Note: This process works best if there is a community of users
supporting the effort, and not just a single translator. The
additional users, even if they cannot help with the translation directly, 
can help review the test build and point out errors in
translation, as well as other localization errors. Others on the
OpenOffice project might be able to help you find other interested
users, so let us know, via a note to the
[L10n list](/mailing-lists.html#localization-mailing-list-public)
if you want that help.
