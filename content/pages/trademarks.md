Title:     Apache OpenOffice Trademarks
Notice: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

## Getting permission to use our trademarks

The Apache Software Foundation holds trademarks on behalf of its
projects. For the Apache OpenOffice project these trademarks include
the names Apache OpenOffice® and OpenOffice.org®, as well as the
[graphical logos][5]. Other graphic formats can be found [here][6].
Use of these marks is prohibited without explicit permission from the
ASF.

However, the Apache OpenOffice project is happy to work with 3rd parties
who desire to use these trademarks in ways that are beneficial
to the project, which do not imply endorsement by ASF, and which are
fully in conformance with Apache policies.

To request such permission, follow these steps:

1. First familiarize yourself with the [Apache Trademark Policy][1].
   Many of the common cases are already addressed there. And some uses
   of ASF marks ("nominative use") are automatically allowed.

1. Email a proposal to [private@openoffice.apache.org][2]. In the
   proposal, please include:

   1. Name and contact information of the company, organization or
      person requesting the permission

   1. A list of what ASF controlled marks you wish to use

   1. A description of how these marks would be used. Give supporting
      detail, along with context. If you are requesting use of the
      logo, for example, provide a prototype of how the logo would
      appear in the context of the overall design.

   1. Any other information you think would be useful, e.g., any
      impeding deadlines

1. On receipt of the proposal, the Apache OpenOffice PMC will review
   and decide whether or not to recommend approval.

1. If the PMC recommends approval, then they will forward their
   recommendation, along with your proposal and any follow up
   communications, to the Apache V.P. of Brand Management for final
   approval.

1. We will then notify you of the outcome.

## Reporting a violation of the Apache OpenOffice trademarks

If you see a possible violation of an OpenOffice-related trademark,
please:

1. Review the details above about the trademarks held by the Apache
   Software Foundation on behalf of the Apache OpenOffice project, and
   about the acceptable usage of trademarks.

1. If this confirms your belief that a website or product is
   infringing one of the above-mentioned trademarks, report it to
   [private@openoffice.apache.org][4]. Make sure you include all
   relevant details, especially, a URL for the offending page.

## The "Get it here!" download logo

A specific logo is recommended for use by those who wish to help
promote the project by hosting a download logo on their website.
The ["Get it here!"][3] logo may be used according to the
requirements listed on that page.
